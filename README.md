## Final Project Submission


## Chicago Car Crashes

## Author: Vinayak Modgil

## Overview
This project uses Machine Learning Algorithms to predict care crashes in the city of Chicago.

## Business Problem
It is very crucial for the Vehicle Safety Board to determine the cause of an accident. With this paricular dataset, the city of Chicago has been chosen for the analysis of the accidents occuring in the city.

## Data 
Quality data of 118,000 car crashes is given.

## Methods
I use various Machine Learning algorithms to predict the possible reason behind the car crashes.

## Results
